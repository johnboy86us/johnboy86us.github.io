  <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm a humble SysAdmin looking to learn how to bring more value to my profession through coding. I am very much a beginner, as you can see from the look and feel of this web page. It's a work-in-progress as I learn HTML, CSS, and more. This page will continue to improve as I learn. I'll also be posting my Codecademy projects below to highlight a specific skill that I am focusing on at the time.</p>
