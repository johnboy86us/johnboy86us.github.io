  </div>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm a humble SysAdmin looking to learn how to bring more value to my profession through coding. I am very much a beginner, as you can see from the look and feel of this web page. It's a work-in-progress as I learn HTML, CSS, and more. This page will continue to improve as I learn. I'll also be posting my <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"><strong>Codecademy</strong></a> projects below to highlight a specific skill that I am focusing on at the time.</p>
  <div id="projects" class="center">
    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <table class="center">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td>Project</td>
          <td>Objective</td>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td><a href="./projects/Dasmoto/index.html">Dasmoto</a>*</td>
          <td>Learning the box model</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td><a href="./projects/Painting/index.html">Painting</a>*</td>
          <td>Fun with colors</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Disclaimer: Many of the projects listed here have been created as forked code from Codecademy. Codecademy offers many base resources that can be modified and built from to create your own unique projects. Many thanks to Codecademy for making these resources available to begin my coding journey! I've put forth a good faith effort to list which projects were derived from Codecademy versus my own creative property.</p>
